# 21 Blackjack

This is a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack game in Python.

## Instructions

1. Run the `blackjack()` function to start the game.
2. Follow the prompts to draw cards or pass.
3. The game will automatically handle the dealer's moves.
4. Once the game ends, you will be prompted to restart.

## Rules

- Each player is dealt two cards to start.
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- Face cards are worth 10, Aces are worth 11 (or 1 if it would put you over 21).
- If the player or dealer gets a total of 21 from the first two cards (a blackjack), they win.
- The dealer must draw cards until their total is 17 or higher.

Have fun playing 21 Blackjack!
